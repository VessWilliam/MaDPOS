# Retail POS System Assessment
Youâ€™ve inherited a legacy internal point-of-sale system for a retail business. Itâ€™s buggy, partially built, lacks documentation, and has several unfinished features. Your task is to:

	â€¢	Extend the functionality
	â€¢	Debug critical issues
	â€¢	Build out reporting/analytics/api
	â€¢	Deploy it online
	â€¢	Follow Git and clean code practices

## Expected Deliverables
	1. Clean Repo
	â€¢	Clear README guide
	â€¢	Meaningful commit messages
	2. Postman Collection
	â€¢	Export the API endpoints as a Postman collection or any openapi format
	â€¢	Include the collection in the repo
    3. Hosting
    â€¢	Host the site on any free or budget hosting platform for at least 3 days for review purpose
	â€¢	DEPLOYMENT.md for hosting guide
    4. Final Report / Video
	â€¢	**SHORT!!!** write-up (1â€“2 pages) answering:
	â€¢	What challenges you faced?
    â€¢	What have you done & how (dev / optimization)?
	â€¢	What would you improve with more time?

ðŸ’¡ Notes
	â€¢	You can use any .NET libraries you want
	â€¢	You can use any CSS/JS frameworks you want
	â€¢	You can use mssql / postgresql
